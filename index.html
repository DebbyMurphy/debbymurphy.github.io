                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>I'm Debby Murphy. A digital marketing an analytics specialist, with 9 years under my belt.</p>
                <p> My areas of speciality:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I help web pages rank in Google, and Bing.</li>
                        <li>When SEO alone doesn't suffice, I am a master of SEM (paid search) - I make every paid media dollar work hard to earn it's place.</li>
                        <li>I love hunting for data-driven insights. I am often found pooring over web analytics and CRM data.</li>
                        <li>I plan and implement website tracking.</li>
                        <li>And, I show people in business how to get the most out of their own website data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>I love to learn. As marketing and technology merge (or rather, have merged) staying ahead of the curve is more important than ever, to deliver sophisticated marketing solutions.</p>
                <p>Right now, I’m upskilling in coding languages HTML, CSS, Python, JS React and Django to powerup my MarTech capabilities. I can’t wait to show you on this site how I will apply this.</p>
